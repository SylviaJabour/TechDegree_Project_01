        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
          I’ve been working as an architect in Brazil since 2010. In 2015, my husband got a job in Montreal and we’ve
          been living here since then.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was to come to Montreal, I looked into validating my diploma and I found out that it would take almost
          the same time a degree in architecture here would. I spent two years studying Archiviz for Architecture, but
          wasn't easy to get a job in that area in the city where I live, so I took a important decision that was to
          study to became a web developer. Since then, I've been going throught a lot doubts about my career.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, I thought with my self: "it will be better if I start from the scratch in an area that I know have a lot
          opportunities than insist in something that can take more time to get some professional oportunity."
        </p>

        <p>That's why I'm doing the Tree House course.</p>
